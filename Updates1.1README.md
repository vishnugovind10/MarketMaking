# Algorithmic Trading Strategy with Portfolio Rebalancing

## Introduction
This repository contains a Python script for implementing an algorithmic trading strategy that incorporates portfolio rebalancing based on predefined thresholds. The script uses real-time trade and order book data from the Binance API to make buy/sell decisions, adjust position sizes, and dynamically rebalance the portfolio.

## Features
- **Automated Trading:** The script fetches real-time trade and order book data from Binance API and uses it to make trading decisions.
- **Portfolio Rebalancing:** The strategy includes an automated portfolio rebalancing mechanism to maintain desired asset weights.
- **Risk Management:** The algorithm employs a stop-loss mechanism to limit potential losses.
- **Dynamic Position Sizing:** The position size for each asset is dynamically adjusted based on predefined rules.

## Implementation Sections

### 1. Initialization and Constants
   - The necessary libraries are imported, and API endpoints and keys are defined for accessing Binance data.
   - The initial account balance is fetched using the Binance API.

### 2. Fetching Trade and Order Book Data
   - Trade data for a specific symbol is fetched from the Binance API and stored in a DataFrame.
   - Order book data for the same symbol is fetched and processed into a DataFrame containing bid and ask prices.

### 3. Calculating Volatility and Moving Averages
   - A function is defined to calculate the market volatility using the standard deviation of trade prices.
   - Another function calculates the moving average of recent trade prices for trend analysis.

### 4. Dynamic Position Sizing and Portfolio Rebalancing
   - A function `adjust_position_size()` is defined to dynamically adjust position sizes based on predefined rules.
   - A function `calculate_portfolio_weights()` calculates the weights of different assets in the portfolio based on expected returns.
   - The script rebalances the portfolio when asset weights deviate from desired levels.

### 5. Trade Execution and P&L Calculation
   - The script iterates through the trade data and uses order book information to determine bid and ask prices.
   - Buy/sell decisions are made based on bid and ask prices, and positions are maintained.
   - The algorithm calculates the dynamic P&L, updates the current balance, and applies a stop-loss mechanism.

### 6. Final Output
   - The script outputs a DataFrame containing trading positions and calculated P&L.
   - The P&L data is saved to a CSV file for further analysis.

## Usage
1. Replace `'your-api-key'` with your actual Binance API key.
2. Define or implement any missing functions (e.g., `get_top_crypto_pairs()`).
3. Set the strategy parameters such as `threshold`, `exchange_fee_rate`, and `max_loss_percentage`.
4. Run the script and observe the trading decisions and rebalancing in action.

## Conclusion
This Python script demonstrates an algorithmic trading strategy that combines real-time data analysis, dynamic position sizing, and portfolio rebalancing. It offers insights into how algorithmic trading strategies can be implemented to manage risk and maintain desired portfolio compositions. Users can customize and enhance this script further to match their specific trading strategies and goals.
